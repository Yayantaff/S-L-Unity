# S-L-Unity
Unity Version 2020.3.11f1

Generates a prototype Snake and Ladder, Single Machine Multi Player, with 1-9 x 1-9 Grid.

This is a Demonstration Prototype.

The Intro Scene accepts four inputs - width of the game block (1-9), height (1-9), and the number of snakes and ladders.

The snakes are represented by red-gray lines, and the ladders by blue.

The generator is rudimentary(doesn't do a strict validity check e.g., 9 snakes and 9 ladders would be difficult for a 3 x 6 grid.), a value of 4 for snakes and ladders and 8 for height and width would generate a decent playable demo. 

A default value of 4 snakes and 4 ladders and 8 for width and 8 for height is provided. The emphasis is on the functional game, rather than on the playability dimensions.

Enhanced around a multiplayer core provided here by a motivated dev. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvJ4_xAxw0U
